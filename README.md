# Arc Suit Classifier

A VIT model for classifying arc flash protective suits in high-voltage and industrial environments, ensuring PPE compliance and worker safety.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project uses a **two-stage detection system**:
1. **YOLOv8** â€” detects persons in the frame.
2. **Vision Transformer (ViT)** â€” classifies cropped person detections into:
   - `arc_suit`
   - `no_arc_suit`

The model is trained on a **custom YOLO-format dataset** FROM RoboFlow.
